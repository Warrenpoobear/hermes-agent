## Purpose

Reference for the spending rule and liquidity management layer of the Wake Robin Liquidity Architecture. Critical context: for this multi-entity SFO, total NAV materially overstates spendable resources. Spending and liquidity decisions must be made against a separately-modeled spendable-resource base.

---

## Spending Rules

ABC: `src/aa_model/spending/base.py`

### Flat-Real Rule

Fixed real spending amount, adjusted for inflation each quarter.

```
quarterly_spend = annual_spend / 4 * (1 + inflation_rate)^quarters_elapsed
```

Simple, predictable. No NAV sensitivity.

### Smoothing Rule

Weighted average of prior spend and current NAV-implied spend.

```
spend_t = weight * (rate * NAV_t) + (1 - weight) * spend_{t-1}
```

Known limitation (L7): when `weight=0`, spending freezes at initial level regardless of NAV changes. Documented, not a bug.

### Owl / Guyton-Klinger Guardrail Rule

File: `src/aa_model/spending/owl_adapter.py`. Advanced guardrail-based withdrawal strategy with prosperity and capital preservation triggers.

Key behaviors: initial spend rate applied to spending base; prosperity rule increases spend when portfolio grows above threshold; capital preservation rule decreases spend when portfolio falls below threshold; guardrails define max/min spend adjustments per period.

Phase 11 fix (L16): Owl now uses absolute-dollar guardrail thresholds, making it scale-invariant in initial NAV. Prior version reacted to forecasted NAV, not realized NAV (L15, resolved Phase 4a).

## Spending Base (Phase 12/12.5)

File: `src/aa_model/spending/spending_base.py`

### The Core Problem (L19)

Total NAV includes PE fund NAV (illiquid, not spendable), development real estate (land carry, not income-producing), and OpCo interests (not automatically liquid). Using total NAV as the spending-rate denominator would suggest the family can spend far more than is actually accessible.

### Configurable Denominator

| Base Type | What It Includes | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| total_nav | Everything | Legacy/simple models |
| liquid_nav | Only liquid buckets | Conservative |
| distributable_income | Income-producing assets only | Most realistic for SFO |

### Distribution Inflow (Phase 13)

`distribution_inflow` is a ledger flow type representing income distributions from illiquid assets that become spendable — bridging the gap between illiquid NAV and actual spending capacity.

---

## Liquidity Coverage

File: `src/aa_model/liquidity/coverage.py`

Reserve Floor: default 18 months of spending in cash + short-term bonds (configurable via `liquidity.floor_months` in base.yaml).

Coverage Ratios: per-period obligations vs period-available liquidity by tier.

### Five-Tier Liquidity Classification

| Tier | Granularity | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Daily | Cash, money market |
| 2 | Monthly | Public equities, liquid bonds |
| 3 | Quarterly | Hedge funds with quarterly redemption |
| 4 | At maturity | Fixed-term vehicles |
| 5 | Locked | PE, development RE, OpCo |

Breach Alerts: triggered when projected outflows exceed tier 1-2 capacity within the planning horizon.

---

## Manager Terms Diagnostics

File: `src/aa_model/liquidity/manager_terms_diagnostics.py`. Per-manager liquidity analysis: redemption notice periods, lock-up periods, gate provisions, side pocket exposure, effective liquidity tier assignment.

---

## Workbook Integration

Cashflow Modeling v7.xlsx (read-only): canonical entity-level cash-flow forecast. Read, normalize, reconcile to it. Do NOT mutate.

Investment Summary Workbook (read-only): canonical position universe with per-position metadata (liquidity bucket 1-5, granularity, cash-flow-producing flag, time horizon, expected standard deviation).

---

## Key Constraints

1. Spending rate denominator must be explicitly configured, not defaulted to total NAV
2. All spending flows land on the quarterly ledger as `flow_type = "spend"`
3. Reserve floor is enforced before rebalancing
4. Liquidity tiering must honor the four-line principle
5. Workbook data is read-only; validation divergence is logged, not silently absorbed
